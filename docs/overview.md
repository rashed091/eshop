### Why a Single-page web application architecture?

So why are single-page web application architectures so popular? I think it can be summed up in the following statement.

> JavaScript libraries and frameworks provide an interactive user experience similar to a desktop or native application that is as easy to update as a web application.

In the past, developers have commonly used technologies from Microsoft (Windows Forms, WPF, Silverlight), Oracle (Java Swing), Adobe (Flash, Flex ) and/or mobile solutions such as iOS or Android development to provide rich interactive user experiences. These technologies were never easy to deploy or update for a large number of users. Which is why the business applications are built as web applications today.

These JavaScript libraries and frameworks allow developers to "have their cake and eat it to" by enabling an interactive user experience while remaining a web application.

## What is React?

    React is SQL for HTML or more specifically the Document Object Model (DOM)

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. More specifically, React provides a declarative library that keeps the DOM in sync with your data.

A declarative language that most developers are familiar with is SQL. SQL is declarative because you declare what data you want and the database figures out how to efficiently return you that data. React is SQL for HTML or more specifically the Document Object Model (DOM). You declare what HTML and data you want and React figures out how to efficently (with the least amount of changes to the DOM) render your data to HTML.

The architecture is component-based and allows you that allow you to create new custom, reusable, encapsulated HTML tags to use in web pages and web apps.

### Why is it useful?

    React makes it painless to create interactive UIs on top of web standards.

## React Architecture

Lots of my students struggle with how everything comes together in a React application.  
Below is a diagram that helps answer that question.
