Aauthentication is hard and I prefer using exsiting oauth system like auth0 provider the facility.


### Auth0 Overview
Auth0 is a flexible, drop-in solution to add authentication and authorization services to your applications. Your team and organization can avoid the cost, time, and risk that come with building your own solution to authenticate and authorize users.

Take a look at just a few of Auth0's use cases:

You built an awesome app and you want to add user authentication and authorization. Your users should be able to log in either with a username/password or with their social accounts (such as Facebook or Twitter). You want to retrieve the user's profile after the login so you can customize the UI and apply your authorization policies.

### Authentication vs. Authorization
While often used interchangeably, authentication and authorization represent fundamentally different functions. In this article, we compare and contrast the two to show how they protect applications in complementary ways.

#### What are authentication and authorization?
In simple terms, authentication is the process of verifying who a user is, while authorization is the process of verifying what they have access to.

Comparing these processes to a real-world example, when you go through security in an airport, you show your ID to authenticate your identity. Then, when you arrive at the gate, you present your boarding pass to the flight attendant, so they can authorize you to board your flight and allow access to the plane.
